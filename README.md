## Project Overview

FindTheTarget uses a genetic algorithm to simulate and visualise the process of dots finding a target. The project showcases evolutionary principles by progressively improving the dot paths through generations.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm:** Simulates the evolution of dot paths to find a target.
- **Visualisation:** Displays the movement and evolution of dots in real-time.
- **Obstacles:** Incorporates obstacles that dots must navigate around to reach the target.
- **Performance Graph:** Displays a graph showing the performance improvement over time.

## Technologies Used

- **P5.js:** JavaScript library for creating graphic and interactive experiences.
- **HTML/CSS:** Markup and styling for the interface.
- **JavaScript:** Core programming language for the algorithm and visualisation.

## Installation
